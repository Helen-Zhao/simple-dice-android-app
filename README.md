# Simple Dice Android Application

A simple dice android application developed in native Java, meant to be used as a companion for tabletop games. 

The application allows the user to choose from a variety of different sided dice and add as many of each as they want to the pool to be rolled. On dice roll, the sum and the results of the individual dice are shown on the screen. There is also a custom dice option where the user can specify unique dice with any number of sides between 0 and 99.
